\chapter*{Abstract}

Cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and big data processing emerged as profoundly disruptive technologies in the technological landscape of recent years. In this work, the state of the art of these technologies was studied in depth, analyzing their intrinsic utility and exploring the different methodologies, techniques, and services available, while also providing a practical implementation to examine their ability to deliver tangible public benefit.

The availability of public datasets at the European level was examined as the foundation of the project, in compliance with the new legal frameworks imposed in this area. Based on this, a replicable methodology was developed that described the journey of data from its origin to the generation of public value, making use of cloud computing and the advanced capabilities of machine learning algorithms, as well as the Auto Machine Learning technologies offered by major public cloud providers. This made it possible to identify the most efficient and optimal configurations for building such solutions, in comparison with other available options. Likewise, it enabled the development of a general overview of the current state of the three technologies under study. %[TODO] 182 palabras, revisar y usar modelos principalmente utilizados, o algo mas especifico
