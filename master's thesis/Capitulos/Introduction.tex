\section{Motivation}

We will start at the beginning by defining what the three main elements of this project are, [TODO] 


The scope of this project is, on the one hand [TODO]

\section{Work plan}


Having defined the scope, I would like to highlight the five phases in which the project has been partitioned, which have been iterated for the creation of several functional prototypes:


\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Research phase.} Search for information about different public data sources, cloud technologies and AI models or tools that help us to treat, filter and understand all the public data collected.
	
	\item \textbf{Requirements analysis phase:} [TODO].
	
	\item \textbf{Implementation phase:} [TODO]

	\item \textbf{Testing phase:} [TODO]
	
	\item \textbf{Memory phase:} [TODO] The elaboration of this document, translating the previous phases into text and specifying the development of the project and its results.

\end{enumerate}
